# css to react JS inline styles
This tool helps you convert normal css to the JSON format that works with react components as inline styles, it was inspired by the one built by staxmanade: https://staxmanade.com/CssToReact/. Note that no code was copied and the inspiration was in the form of the project's idea and general UI.
